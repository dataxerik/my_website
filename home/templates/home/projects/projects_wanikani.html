                <h3>What is kanji and WaniKani?</h3>
                    <p>
                        When learning Japanese, there are 3 types of writing systems one needs to learn:
                        <b>Hiragana</b>, <b>Katakana</b>, and <b>Kanji</b>. The first two are pretty easy as they are like the
                        English alphabet and both only have 46 characters. However, Japanese also uses
                        Chinese characters also know as Kanji. Kanji is a lot harder to learn comparatively
                        since there are over <b>2000</b> characters.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Various solutions have come to help Japanese learners, one of these solutions is
                        WaniKani. Wanikani is a website that uses spaced repetition. In other words, every
                        level they quiz one on a certain subset of Kanji, and once you master that level then
                        one levels up. Right now, there are 60 levels.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        For each level, you are given radicals(characters that make up kanji), kanji, and vocabulary.
                        The objective is get a 'burned' level for each item. The levels are 'apprentice', 'guru', 'master'
                        , 'enlightened', and 'burned'
                        On top of this service, WaniKani provides an API where those interested can get various
                        statistics about his or her account such 'how many times they got a certain kanji wrong'
                        or 'when was this kanji unlocked'. So, inspired by a <a href="https://www.idigtech.com/wanikani/">similar site</a>, I've
                        created my own version using Django.

            <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                Create a small supplement website to allow users to view there average time per level,
                his or her level of accuracy, and give clear visual of progress.

            Each user as an API key that I can use to gather the user information. So, the home page is asking for the
            user's key. Once they enter a valid key, the next screen is the statistics page.

            <p>This page has three main sections. One section to give the general user statistics like current level and
                number of items learned, the next section to give the user's accuracy, and the last section is a graph
                showing the user's average time per level.</p>

            <p>After arriving at this page, the user can go to two additional pages: the comparison and charts page</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Comparison Page</h3>
            <p>For kanji, there are three popular group: one based on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test(JLPT),
            one decided by the Japanese Ministry of Education(Joyo), and one based on the frequency of kanji use(Freq).
            On the comparison screen, there is a data visualization of each grouping where the user has a level of 'guru'
            or higher for a given kanji. This way the user can clear see his or her current progress as a gauge.</p>

            <br>
            <h3>Chart Page</h3>
            <p>The user can also view each individual kanji grouped by JLPT, Joyo, and Freq level. Furthermore, they
            can see the kanji's level(unranked, apprentice, guru, master, enlightened, burned).</p>
