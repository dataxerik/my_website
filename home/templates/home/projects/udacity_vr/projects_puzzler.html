                    <p>
                        &ensp;Udacity offers a self-paced program that teaches people to develop for VR applications. As part
                        of Term 2, I needed to construct a small simon-says like puzzle project. The focus of this project
                        was user testing. I need to have various test done, and make iterative improvments to the
                        project You can find more details about the program

        <h1>Project</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                &ensp;The basic flow of the game is the user is asked if they want to 'go on an adventure'. Then, the user is
                taken inside a small building to solve a simon-says puzzle. After successfully solving the problem, the user
                is moved to the end and shown the restart screen.

                 src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerStartScreen.png' %}"
                 height="200" width="500">
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;The building and puzzle elements were provided as a part of the project. However, there were still several
            things that needed to be designed: the UI and environment. So, before creating anything in Unity, I created
            sketches for easy prototypes.</p>
            <img class="imageCenter" src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerDesignDocuments.png' %}"
                 height="200" width="500">
            <p>
            &ensp;The above pictures is a simple sketch of the environment. The upper-left picture is an aerial view of the
            environment. The build is the square and is surrounded by mountains. I wanted the user to feel enclosed.
            This way the environment helps point the user to the building more so because the user has no where else to go. Also,
            having the building surrounded by mountains, I feel, makes it feel more foreboding.
            <br>
                &ensp;The upper-right picture is the user looking forward at the building. The same building as in the
                upper-left picture. The below picture is the what I ended up making in Unity.
            </p>
            <img class="imageCenter" src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerEnvironment.png' %}"
                 height="200" width="500">
            <img class="imageCenter" src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerDesignDocuments1.png' %}"
                 height="200" width="500">
            <p>&ensp;The above UI pictures were something I want to keep pretty simple and to the point. However, I
                didn't want to make the UI too bland. There should be a flair of adventure. So, the starting UI ask
                'Do you want to go on an adventure?'. And, Since the adventure is pretty short, I want to hint at the
                possibility of there being more. So, the restart UI was designed to have a message like 'that's the
                end for now...'

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>After finalizing the draft, I created the UI, setup the puzzle and end room</p>
            <div>
                <div class="imageSideBySideDiv">
                <img src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerUI.png' %}"

                </div>
                <div class="imageSideBySideDiv">
                <img src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerPuzzleRoom.png' %}"
                     height="350">
                </div>
                <img class="imageCenter" src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerEndScreen.png' %}"
                     height="350" width="500">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Testing & Improvements</h2>
            <p>Testing was an interesting experience that you can see more about
                <a href="https://medium.com/@dsshar/puzzler-aca3a699e129">here</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>One notable chance was that I added a small clue to the side of the wall that can be seen below.</p>
            <img class="imageCenter" src="{% static 'home/pictures/puzzler_pictures/PuzzlerPuzzleRoom.png' %}"
                 height="350" width="500">
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>
            <p>This was a good experience that I really enjoyed, and help me strength my design skills. And, it opened
            my mind to some of the issues users who don’t have a lot of experience can face.
            <br>
            <br>
            I think one issue that will always be a challenge is effectively communicating the idea of a VR experience
            with minimum words. As a gamer, I know that introducing a experience with a long wordy tutorial can be a
            major turn to keep play. And, those explanations can just be ignored.
            <br>
            <br>
            So, even though I could convey this puzzle in a simple passage, I would prefer not to. In this project, I
            struggled with this objective. The puzzle was unclear to the testers. I need to find a better way to
            communicate the game’s objective. One thing I noticed is that while the testers heard the failure sound for
            orb, the sound’s meaning wasn’t intuitive.
            <br>
            <br>
                I’m think maybe having a visual mark like a red ‘x’ could better convey the message. Also, I could had a
                beginner level where there are like 1–2 orbs and only one flashes once, so the user can more quickly try
                things out and figure out the puzzle’s objective.
            </p>
            <h3>Future plans</h3>
            <p>
                I would like to implement a more robust hint system or tutorial level and to try to make the environment
                better.
