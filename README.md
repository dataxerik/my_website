# Purpose: This is a personal project that I use to help my develop my django and python skills.

# Description: There are five apps in the project. Games, home, mysite, polls, and wanikani.

# The app games is very much under deployed. The idea of the app was just an area for me to take about games.

# The app home was my first attempt of making my own app after I read the django tutorial. The purpose of this app was
# to be a hub where I could navigate between the other apps(polls, games, and wanikani).

# The app waninkani is used to give my statistics about my progressing using the wanikani app. It was inspired by a
# third party site. This site gives statistics about his or her progress such as how much time they spent on a given
# level.

# The polls app is just the django tutorial. More information can be found here https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/intro/
# for the nature of the app.
